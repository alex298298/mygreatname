				<h3>Notice - March 20, 2024</h3>

			<p>Please read our Notice dated March 8, 2024, and response urgently!</p>
			<p style="margin-left:20px; color: red;">**** If you still have not taken any response before March 25, your domains may be left unattended. We provide enough time for all customers to handle their domains. This is your responsibility not to take care of your domains. There is nothing we can do if you keep not taking any response and action!</p>

				<h3>Notice - March 8, 2024 (Revised)</h3>
				<p>IMPORTANT: MyGreaName.com Cease to Provide Domain Registration Service (Need Response!)</p>
				<p>Dear Customers,</p>

				<p>It is with regret to inform you that MyGreatName.com will no longer provide domain registration from March 20, 2024. This decision has been taken predominantly due to the changing business environment.</p>

<p>We have a plan to maintain your domains registered through MyGreatName.com working normally. </p>

<p>As you know, we are using the eNom registrar, our plan is simply move your domains into your own eNom account. Therefore your domain dashboard, zone records are exactly the same as now. Moreover, the domain registration fees and renewal fees should be the same as MyGreatName. I am sure this is the best arrangement for our customers.</p>
 
<p>Here’s our planning:<p>

<p>1. We create an eNom account for each customer. </p>

<p>2. Your domain(s) will be pushed into your eNom account. </p>

<p>After the move, you will deal with eNom directly. You can login your eNom account, renew domains, register domains, ask for support or questions, transfer domains, etc… . The only diffence is that eNom only accept Credit Card payment, no more Bank Transfer.</p>

<p>After the move, your domains are under eNom directly, and no any relationshop with MyGreatName.com. Therefore we cannot provide support anymore. If you need support, just login your eNom account and submit a ticket.</p>


<p>Need Your Response and Action:<br/>
================================</p>
<p>1. If you accept this arrangement, please reply this email before March 15, 2024. We will create an eNom account for you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>2. If you do not accept this arrangement, you can transfer your domains to other registrars. However please take action before March 20, 2024.</p>

<p>3. If all your domains will not be renewed, no action is required. You can still login the domain control panel as usual until expiry date.</p>
<p>=================================</p>

<p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your loyalty in choosing us as your domain provider over the years. It has been a pleasure to provide services to all of you.</p>
